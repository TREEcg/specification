# Provenance and Summaries

A tree:Node can be a result from a calculation that was done on top of the data. It is important for the clients to understand how this was done, and what the summaries can be used for. Therefore, if the tree:Node does not contain actual information but a summary, some extra metadata _should_ be added.
